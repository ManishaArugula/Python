# ðŸ“Š Data Job Market Analysis with Python

This project is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of job postings in the UK data job market, inspired by a dataset and tutorial shared by Luke Barousse(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUSDVGivd-8). The goal was to practice Python for data analysis while uncovering real insights into job trends, skills demand, and salary patterns for Data Analyst and related roles.

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Libraries Used

1. Python 

2. NumPy â€“ numerical computations

3. Pandas â€“ data manipulation & cleaning

4. Matplotlib â€“ data visualization

5 Seaborn â€“ advanced plotting & styling

## ðŸ“Œ Key Insights

âœ… 91% of job postings in the UK have a work-from-home option.

âœ… 71% of postings list a degree requirement.

âœ… 100% of postings include health insurance as a benefit.

âœ… Joblead.UK and ClickJobs.io are the top sources for Data Analyst postings.

## Skills & Salary Insights

ðŸ”¹ SQL and Python are the most in-demand skills.

ðŸ”¹ SQL, Python, Excel, and Tableau dominate postings and are linked with salaries around $85K+.

ðŸ”¹ Specialized tools like Snowflake, Looker, and cloud services appear less frequently but are associated with $100K+ salaries.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Workflow

1. Data Loading & Cleaning â€“ imported dataset, handled missing values, formatted job features.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis â€“ explored job distributions, requirements, and benefits.

3. Skills Analysis â€“ calculated frequency and demand for technical skills.

4. Salary Analysis â€“ compared skills vs. average salaries.

5. Visualizations â€“ created charts (pie, bar, line plots) with annotations and styling.
